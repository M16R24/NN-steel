# NN-steel
Implementation of Neural Networks to predict the composition of structural steel.

A two layer neural network is implemented to make analysis of the data. </br>
The data set contains 16 columns among 4 labeled layers which shows the mechanical properties of the respective alloy </br>

The model R²_score value for individual mechanical property is listed below. </br>
The total wall time is 1m 42s to execute the model. </br>

R²_score for 0.2% Proof Strength = 0.84 </br>
R²_score for Tensile strength    = 0.95 </br>
R²_score for % Elongation        = 0.65 </br>
R²_score for % Reduction in Area = 0.8 </br>
