# NN-steel
Implementation of Neural Networks to predict the composition of structural steel.

A two layer neural network is implemented to make analysis of the data.
The data set contains 16 columns among 4 labeled layers which shows the mechanical properties of the respective alloy

The model R²_score value for individual mechanical property is listed below.
The total wall time is 1m 42s to execute the model.

R²_score for 0.2% Proof Strength = 0.84 \n
R²_score for Tensile strength    = 0.95
R²_score for % Elongation        = 0.65
R²_score for % Reduction in Area = 0.8
